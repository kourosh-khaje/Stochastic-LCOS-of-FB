# Asymmetric FB Stochastic LCOS

## Overview

This open-source script provides a complete framework for estimating levelized cost of storage (LCOS) across eight asymmetric flow-battery chemistries via deterministic ranking and 10 000-run Monte-Carlo risk analysis.

## Features

• Ready-to-run – only numpy, pandas, scipy, matplotlib required

• Compares V-V baseline vs. V-H₂, V-Zn, V-Br, V-Ce, V-Mn, V-Fe, V-O₂ (15–65 Wh L⁻¹)

• Validates against DOE target (0.05 USD kWh⁻¹ cycle⁻¹) and 20 % reduction threshold

• Outputs Markdown tables and publication-ready figures that can be pasted directly into papers or reports


## Methodology

NREL-style LCOS model coupled with log-normal Monte-Carlo simulation (10 000 runs, 95 % CI) to generate VaR(95 %) and risk-adjusted returns; bubble sizes scale with energy density.

## Applications

• Research institutions: Benchmark novel electrolyte formulations

• Industry stakeholders: Screen chemistries for MW-scale cost-down studies

• Policy makers: Assess cost-target feasibility for long-duration storage

• Investors: Risk-return evaluation under price uncertainty
